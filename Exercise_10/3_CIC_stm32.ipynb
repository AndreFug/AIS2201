    "# Implementing a CIC filter using C \n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a filter on a microprocessor, we generally need three things:\n",
    "1. State variables which can retain information about the filter state between filtering operations.\n",
    "2. A way to initialize filter states.\n",
    "3. A function to process the input data $x[n]$ and calculate the output data $y[n]$. This could either be done on a sample-by-sample basis, or using entire arrays as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were programming in C++, Java, Python or any other object oriented language, all of the above could be wraped int one class. However, since we are programing the stm32 in C, we will have to make do with the next-best thing: structs and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task we will have a closer look at one possible implementation of a CIC filter, where we process an entire array of input data (such as the array `ADC_buffer` from assignment $6$). The structure of the solution is closely modeled on similar functions in the CMSIS-DSP library we used to perform the RFFT in assignment $6$."
