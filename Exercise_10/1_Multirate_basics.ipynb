    "\n",
    "In a number of situations, it is desirable to convert a digital signal $x_{\\text{old}}[n]$ acquired at sampling frequency $f_{s, \\text{ old}}$ to a new sampling frequency $f_{s, \\text{ new}}$, producing a new signal $x_{\\text{new}}[m]$. The reasons for doing this might be comparing streams of data with different sample rates, or reducing the sample rate of a signal which was initially [oversampled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling). Given that both $x_{\\text{old}}[n]$ and $x_{\\text{new}}[m]$ are a discrete-time representation of the same analog signal $x(t)$, the ideal result is for the signal $x_{\\text{new}}[m]$ to be an exact discrete-time representation of $x(t)$ (assuming the nyquist criterion is met with the new sampling frequency $f_{s, \\text{ new}}$):\n",
