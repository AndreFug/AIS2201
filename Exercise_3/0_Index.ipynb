    "# Exercise 3: Sampling, aliasing and A/D conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a lab exercise consisting of preparatory theory questions, and practical lab assignments where we will set up and observe the behavior of A/D and D/A conversion. This is also the first exercise where we will make use of our STM32 F446re Nucleo board, which we will make use of throughout this semester. As such, a secondary goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the STM32 CubeIDE programming environment which it is highly recommended you make use of when programming the microcontroller (at least to start with).\n",
