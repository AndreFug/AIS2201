    "# Part 4: Lab measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now conduct measurements of the apparent frequency in the DAC output, and compare this to the actual frequency in the sine wave from the signal generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few useful tools:\n",
    "* The run/stop button on the oscilloscope can make the waveform easier to read, as it lets you focus on one snapshot instead of a continuously updated image.\n",
    "* Setting the oscilloscope channel input to AC will cancel out the voltage offset, making it easier to zoom in/out on the signal.\n",
    "* Measuring a signal period can be done using \"cursor measure\", and e.g. measuring the time difference between positive zero crossings. It may be advantageous to mesure the time difference over a large number of oscillations in order to calculate an \"average period\"."
