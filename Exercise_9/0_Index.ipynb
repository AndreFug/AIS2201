    "# Exercise 9 - Analysis and design of FIR filters\n",
    "\n",
    "In exercise 8 we learned about convolution and correlation, and how the shape of a filter's impulse response $h[n]$ deterimines what type of signals are allowed to pass through the filter. In this exercies we will focus on the frequency response $H(\\hat{\\omega})$ of FIR filters, which is calculated by taking the discrete-time fourier transform (DTFT) of the impulse respones $h[n]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency response $H(\\hat{\\omega})$ of a filter gives insight into how a sinusoidal input $x[n]$ is affected by the filter. The most common way to visualize the frequency response of a filter is with a pair of plots: a magnitude response plot $|H(\\hat{\\omega})|$ and a phase response plot $\\angle H(\\hat{\\omega})$. The code cell below will load a demo showing the magnitude/phase response of a customizable filter `hn` as well as a time plot showing input/output waveforms for an adjustable frequency.\n"
