    "Finding the correct filter impulse response $h[n]$ is *almost* as simple as calculating the Inverse Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (IDTFT) of $H(\\hat{\\omega})$, with some adjustments necessary to make the filter realizable. In this problem we will walk through the process step-by-step, and investigate *why* the various adjustments are necessary.\n"
