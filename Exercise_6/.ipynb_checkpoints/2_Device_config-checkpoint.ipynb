    "## About Hardware Timers and Periodic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In Assignment 3 we used the ADC in \"Continuous Mode\" to achieve high-speed sampling. While this is quite an effective method, it limits us to a relativeley inflexible set of possible sampling frequencies determined by system clock speed and ADC configuration. Another possibility is to use a hardware timer to generate a trigger signal which tells the ADC when to start a conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware timers are relatively simple digital circuits which are used to generate PWM signals, set the speed for serial commuication and so on. Very briefly explained, the main component is a counting register which can increment the binary number stored in the register by `1` for each clock cycle. Then, when the counting register reaches a pre-configured value stored in a `Auto Reload Register` the timer generates an output, and all the bits in the counting register are set to `0` so the timer can begin counting up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output generated by a hardware timer can be used to trigger ADC conversion in discontinuous mode, meaning the ADC will read one sample from the analog input each time it is triggered by the hardware timer's trigger event. Assuming the full ADC conversion time is lower than the time between timer trigger events, the ADC's sampling frequency can be calculated as follows:\n",

    "#### Generating trigger signal with a hardware timer\n",
    "\n",
    "On the STM32 F446RE we can use Timer 2 as a source for trigger events for ADC1. In the \"Device Configuration\" tool, select \"Timers->TIM2\" and set Channel 1 to \"PWM Generation No Output\". Then, go to the configuration window for TIM2 and enter the Auto Reload Register value. [Here](Figures/HwTimConfig.png) is a screenshot highlighting the configuration options we need to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we want the ADC to sample at a sampling frequency $f_s = 10\\ 000 \\text{ Hz}$. Using default settings for the system clock, the clock speed will be $84 MHz$, what value must the Auto Reload Register have in order to accomplish this?"

    "The ADC has the option to write newly converted samples directly to a buffer array, using Direct Memory Access. When sampling in this mode the ADC will not trigger interrupt requests every time it has completed an analog-to-digital conversion, but rather once a certain number of samples have been stored to the buffer. DMA can be configured to operate in either \"normal mode\" (once the buffer is full, sampling stops) or \"circular mode\" (once the buffer is full, start over).\n",
