    "# Programming the STM32 to do short-time fourier transforms\n",

    "Computing the FFT of an array in Python is a relatively simple operation, but on an STM32 with relatively limited processing power and memory available there are some added considerations we need to be aware of:\n",
    "1. Standard FFT algorithms rely on the data size $N$ being a power of 2 meaning $\\log2(N)$ must be a whole number\n",
    "2. The maximum supported FFT size is $N = 4096$ samples (and the minimum is $N=16$), resulting in a finite set of possible window lengths $N \\in \\{16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happily, our chosen window length of $N=1024$ exists in the aforementioned set, so we should not encounter any problems there. If you check the library files, you will find a large number of FFT functions. We will be using `arm_rfft_fast_f32` which calculates the RFFT of a real-valued signal represented with 32-bit floating point values. As discussed in the introduction of the assignment, the output of an RFFT discards the negative half of the frequency spectrum, returning only $\\frac{N}{2} + 1$ complex values (the \"$+1$\" occurs due to including both endpoints $m=0$ and $m = \\frac{N}{2}$. For more information, see the [fencepost problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error#Fencepost_error)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The software enineers at ARM have optimized the RFFT output a little bit however, making things easier in some ways and more complicated in other ways. Since both $X[0]$ and $X\\left[\\frac{N}{2}\\right]$ always purely real-valued numbers, these can be \"packed\" into the space otherwise reserved for one complex number. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Array representing complex data $X[m] = RFFT(x[n])$:\n",

    "\n",
    "The upside to this, is that both the input data array and output data array for calculation the RFFT will be a floating-point array with `WINDOW_SIZE` entries. However, correctly interpreting the RFFT output will involve some extra steps."
