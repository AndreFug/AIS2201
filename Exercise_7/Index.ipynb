    "In **Exercise 6** we implemented a simple frequency detection algorithm on an STM32, with the aim of detecting the dominant frequency of an analog voltage signal which was measured with the STM32's internal ADC. The frequency detection algorithm in question does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divides the input signal $x[n]$  into \"windows\" of length $N$ samples.\n",
    "2. Calculates the one-sided DFT for real-valued signals (RFFT).\n",
    "3. Identifies the highest peak location along the frequency axis (ignoring the DC component $X[0]$).\n",
    "5. Returns peak location as frequency in Hz, which is calculated using the sampling frequency.\n",

    "The first milestone for your individual project is to create a test framework for your improved frequency detection system which can simulate a variety of input signals, and subject the frequency detection algorithm to these test signals. The goal is to create a system for evaluating the performance of the frequency detection algorithm given a some of specific types of input signal. This way you can have a basis for evaluating the performance of your improved frequency detection system, using the frequency detection system from **Assignment 6** as expressed in `baseline_algorithm.py` as a basis for comparison.\n",
