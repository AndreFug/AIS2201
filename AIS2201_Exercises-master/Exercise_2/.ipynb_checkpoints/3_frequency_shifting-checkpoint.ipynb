    "### An introduction to two-sided frequency spectrums\n",
    "\n",
    "In problem 2 we observed that a sinusoid $x(t) = A \\cdot \\cos(\\omega \\cdot t + \\phi )$ with unknown phase and magnitude can be decomposed into pure sine and cosine terms by multiplying $x(t)$ by a sine and cosine function respectively. This process is called **frequency mixing**, which has an interesting effect on the frequency spectrum of $x(t)$. However, to gain a full picture of the effects of frequency mixing, we need to study *both sides* of the spectrum. Somtheing which may not be readily apparent when first encountering the fourier transform (as described in eq. $1$ below, is that there is no mathematical reason the function $X(f)$ representing the signal in the frequency domain, should only be valid for $f \\geq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)\\cdot e^{j2\\pi \\cdot f \\cdot t} dt \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of *negative frequencies* and a *two-sided frequency spectrum* often seems a bit strange when first introduced. However, for real-valued signals the frequency spectrum will always be complex conjugate symmetric ($X(-f) = X^*(f)$). The key here is that the frequency spectrum $X(f)$ of a signal, being based on the fourier transform, in fact decomposes a signal into *rotating phasors* $\\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot e^{j\\omega \\cdot t}$, where $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is a complex magnitude. Seeing as the sum of a pair of phasors with opposite directions of rotation add together to form a sinusoid as equation $2$ descirbes, the true magnitude of a sinusoid is found by combining the magnitude of both peaks at frequency $\\pm \\omega$ in the two-sided frequency spectrum.\n",

    "### Frequency mixing portrayed in the frequency domain\n",
    "If we use the equation $2$ to calculate the product of a sinusoid with frequency $f_1$, and a sinusoid with frequency $f_2$, we wil end up with 4 rotating phasors: two with frequency $\\pm (f_1 + f_2)$ and the other two with angular frequency $\\pm(f_1 - f_2)$. The code cell below generates a interactive demonstration of how frequency mixing affects a signal in both the time and frequency domain. Run the cell, and try adjusting the various parameters to see the effects. Take special note of how the product signal has 4 frequency spikes, except when $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the same."
