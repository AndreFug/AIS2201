    "# Predicting the tides\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have become familiar with how the fourier series decomposition works, it is time to apply the principles to our tide prediction problem. Step one is to get our hands on some historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical tide levels in Ålesund\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an idea of what time interval of tide measurements to analyze, it is time to get our hands on some actual measurements. Attached to this exercise is a python module with functions to download tidal measurements taken in Ålesund at **10** minute intervals up until **23:50** last night. The input argument `N_days_recorded` defines the lenght of the historical log in days. The data is sourced from Kartverket.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--. One well known early use of Fourier Series relates to predicting ocean tide levels. Back in the 19th century the vast majority of transportation was done by sea, and having access to reliable prediction for tide levels in different port locations was highly desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1867, William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) developed a method for predicting tide levels by calculating the sum of a numbuer of sinusoids. This was accomplished by subjecting historical tide measurements to Fourier Series decomposition, and then using the resulting fourier series to generate a tide prediction as a mathematical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure]\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, fourier series decomposition involves analyzing a periodic function $x(t)$ over a period of time known as the fundamental period $T$ as illustrated above. The idea being that once you can find a function to describe mathematically the values of $x(t)$ within the time frame $0 \\leq t < T$, the value of $x(t)$ for any other point in time can be easily extrapolated due to the repeating nature of the function $x(t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice few real-world phenomena can be modeled perfectly as periodic functions, but tide levels which are governed primarily by rotations of the earth and moon come pretty close. Seeing as a [lunar day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_day) corresponds to *approximately* $29 \\frac{1}{2}$ day, one suggestion for choice of fundamental-ish period $T$ for use in fourier analysis is $59 \\text{ earth days} \\approx 2 \\text{ lunar days}$.\n",
